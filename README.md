This for the most part made of my own files.
The file of ventoy is here.
If you don't know what ventoy is.....well then let me tell you.
Web https://www.ventoy.net/en/download.html

Following is from website
"Ventoy is an open source tool to create bootable USB drive for ISO/WIM/IMG/VHD(x)/EFI files.
With ventoy, you don't need to format the disk over and over, you just need to copy the ISO/WIM/IMG/VHD(x)/EFI files to the USB drive and boot them directly.
You can copy many files at a time and ventoy will give you a boot menu to select them."
